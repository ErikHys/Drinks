This simple bourbon cocktail dates back to the Prohibition era, though its origin is a matter of some debate. It appeared (with a charming line illustration) in the 1933 book, Hollywood Cocktails by George Buzza Jr.—but that drink was quite possibly lifted from Harry Craddock’s earlier Savoy Cocktail Book, where the bourbon, grapefruit, and honey combination appeared under a different name. Regardless, it's a tasty, easy drink.
