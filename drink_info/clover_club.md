The Clover Club cocktail can be traced back to the late 1800s and Philadelphiaâ€™s Bellevue-Stratford hotel. This popular hangout drew crowds of writers, lawyers and titans of industry, who convened to talk about issues of the day. Naturally, their meetings included drinks, and the Clover Club with gin, fresh lemon juice, raspberry syrup and egg white was a favorite among this genteel set.
