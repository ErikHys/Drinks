The Negroni is one of the most famous Italian cocktails in the world: it has an unmistakable taste and is served in a low, ice-filled tumbler, with a fragrant slice of orange. The origin of this cocktail is all Italian: it seems that at the beginning of the 1920s, Count Camillo Negroni, a charming cosmopolitan and a regular at the aristocratic Caff√® Casoni in Florence, returning from one of his trips to London, asked barman Fosco Scarselli for "a splash of gin" instead of soda in his Americano.
