The Brandy Flip is a simple, 3-ingredient cocktail with a rich flavour and creamy texture. The very first Flips emerged as early as the late 1600s - they were originally created with a mixture of sugar, eggs and spices being added to a tankard of ale before being heated with a red-hot iron poker from the fire. Now, a Flip commonly refers to a cocktail of fortified wine or spirit and whole egg sweetened with sugar.
